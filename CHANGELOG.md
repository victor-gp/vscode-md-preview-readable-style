## Unreleased

## 0.2.0 - 2023-02-02

- Color the `a:active` outline like the theme's `textLink.foreground` color.
- Make the color for `<hr>` and table borders more neutral (on Lucario Theme).
- Color `<code>` elements the same as normal text, instead of the same color as `inline code` in markdown source files.

## 0.1.0 - 2022-10-25

- Initial release.
- Half-backed but I want to use this at work already.
