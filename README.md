# Markdown Preview Readable Styling

Based on Matt Bierner's [Markdown Preview Github Styling](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles), but preserving the color choices of your theme.

It increases font size, limits the width of the text, adds a background shadow to inline code, etc.

#todo: add screenshots of dark & light themes

I only made this extension because there's no way to set a Markdown Preview stylesheet at the user level, only at the workspace level. It's explained in [this vscode issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/45260).

## Further improvements

This extension only styles the Markdown preview. There are other extensions that add support for Markdown features like `:emoji:` and `- [ ]` tasklists.

[This extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview) is a good starting point to enable these.
